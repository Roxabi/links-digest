# Frontend Slides

A Claude Code skill for creating stunning, animation-rich HTML presentations — from scratch or by converting PowerPoint files.

## What This Does

**Frontend Slides** helps non-designers create beautiful web presentations without knowing CSS or JavaScript. It uses a "show, don't tell" approach: instead of asking you to describe your aesthetic preferences in words, it generates visual previews and lets you pick what you like.

Here is a deck about the skill, made through the skill:

### Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools, no frameworks.
- **Visual Style Discovery** — Can't articulate design preferences? No problem. Pick from generated visual previews.
- **PPT Conversion** — Convert existing PowerPoint files to web, preserving all images and content.
- **Anti-AI-Slop** — Curated distinctive styles that avoid generic AI aesthetics (bye-bye, purple gradients on white).
- **Production Quality** — Accessible, responsive, well-commented code you can customize.
